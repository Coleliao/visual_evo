## Single-nucleus profiling decoding the subcortical visual pathway evolution of vertebrates

## Abastract
During the evolution of vertebrates, significant transformations have occurred in visual transmission and processing. However, we barely know the cellular differences in the two visual pathways within vertebrates and the molecular basis for their evolutionary transformation. The emerging technologies and comparative analysis have provided us with a more comprehensive way to decipher this process. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) onto the avian optic tectum, one of the key visual subcortical hubs in birds, and constructed a cellular landscape of it. Integrating this with the mammalian snRNA-seq data, we revealed differences in the density of two types of thalamic projecting excitatory neurons in the retinotectal pathway between birds and mammals. Meanwhile, a series of shared molecules were identified between two types of dominant visual pathways in vertebrates. This work innovatively concentrated on neural pathway evolution and provided a roadmap for its comparative analysis.
